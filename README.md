## **Academic Material**

This repository contains educational material with explanations of Life Cycle Management and Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
of energy systems using MATLAB & Simulink.

The folders are organised following the V-model for Life Cycle management (in phases). Moreover, all files and folders are organised in a MALTAB project.
